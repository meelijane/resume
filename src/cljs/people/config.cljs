Amelia always seems to know what's cool before you but she'll never make you feel inadequate about it, instead she'll genuinely be excited to introduce you to something new.
Working in the same office as Amelia was an absolute pleasure and I wish that more people were as socially pleasant and passionate about their career as Amelia."}
